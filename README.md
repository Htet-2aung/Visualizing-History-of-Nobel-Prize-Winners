## Overview

The Nobel Prize has been one of the most prestigious international awards since its inception in 1901. Each year, prizes are awarded in the fields of chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. Recipients not only gain honor and prestige but also receive a substantial monetary award along with a gold medal featuring the image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), the founder of the prize.

The Nobel Foundation has provided a comprehensive dataset of all prize winners from 1901 to 2023. This dataset, sourced from the Nobel Prize API, is available in the `nobel.csv` file located in the `data` folder.
